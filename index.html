                <p> A global pandemic, lies and strife in the oval office, melting glaciers, war, and extreme weather: this is the world wherein Generation Z, the <a href= "https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far/"> cluster </a> of youngsters born after 1996, grows up. Smart phones in hand, with disaster crowding within and beyond the blue glow, more and more members of this generation are turning to spiritual mediums for understanding themselves and world beyond. </p>
                <p> One sign of rising interest in spiritual mediums is the booming physic services industry, which was worth 2.2 billion <a href= "https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/psychic-services-industry/" > dollars </a> in 2019 and continues to swell. Swirling amidst tarot reading, psychic work and spell casting is a spiritual giant: astrology. The practice linking the rotations of planets to personality has spread across the back pages of numerous magazines and websites and enters the daily lives of <a href= "https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/top-10-u-s-astrology-apps-drew-in-40m-in-2019-up-65-from-2018/">millions</a> of Generation Z through apps. </p>
                <p> Co-Star, one such app, has turned astrology into a social media: users can compare their astrological profiles with those of their friends, and opt to receive daily star-based information in the form of curt message banners. Launched in 2017, the app has garnered 6 million dollars from investors and boasts <a href= "https://www.vogue.com/article/whats-co-star-astrology-app-technology-spirituality#:~:text=Though%20the%20company%20is%20just,than%20%246%20million%20in%20investment.">5.3</a> million global users as of 2019. </p>

                <p> Does the rise of astrology’s popularity mean millions more people believe planets influence our genes, personalities, and life trajectories? <a href= "https://www.vogue.com/article/whats-co-star-astrology-app-technology-spirituality#:~:text=Though%20the%20company%20is%20just,than%20%246%20million%20in%20investment."> Scientists</a> at the University of Arizona found this not to be the case. Surveying University of Arizona undergraduates for twenty years, researchers found that belief in astrology did not correlate with scientific literacy, which is the ability to understand, apply, and build upon scientific concepts. </p> 
                <p> A more likely explainer of astrology’s rise is the current chaotic, tumultuous state of the world. Indeed, research shows that surges in astrology correspond with political and economic chaos. In Germany in the years between 1918 and 1940, as wages, employment, industrial production plummeted, the number of astrological themed articles in newspapers <a href= "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167282084021">soared. </a> Similarly, astrology themed books and magazine articles <a href= "https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-05189-001">spiked</a> in the United States during the Great Depression. Personal crises, too, can trigger people to pull meaning from the planets; a 1998 <a href= "https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1027%2F1016-9040.3.3.202"> study </a> found that the number of personal crises experienced by students correlated with interest in astrology. </p>

                <p> Sofia Long, a senior at UC Berkeley, agrees that she seeks out astrology when life feels out of control. “When I look to things like horoscopes, I’m definitely looking for some sort of emotional answer. I usually seek that stuff out in times of transition or turmoil, sometimes when I’m shifting gears,” she says. She mainly uses Co-Star to get her astrology information. </p> 
                <p> Sequoia Ricks, a junior at UC Berkeley, also turns to astrology more frequently when she’s feeling sad or confused. Of astrology, she says, “Its something that you can use to help to guide your life, if you want. Even though its fake, its kind of fun, and comforting, to have something that's telling you why you are the way you are, why your day was the way that it was.” </p>
                <p> Long and Ricks downloaded Co-Star shortly after it came out. Both use it for personal guidance and as a social medium. Long downloaded it following the goading of her friends. Ricks says the majority of her friends are on the app, which, along with astrology’s spread along other social medias, has allowed the practice to be a way to reflect, joke about, and compare the personalities of her and her friends. </p>
                <p> “I think its something we laugh at together. We jab at each other for being whatever sign we are,” Ricks says. Sometimes, the jokes go too far. “I know my gemini friends get really hurt when we say things about them being a gemini, because geminis suck,” Sequoia adds. Her friends chuckle beside her; the fact that geminis are the worst sign is a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kg4qp/geminis-worst-qualities-liars">running </a> joke online. </p>
                <p> Anna Murray, a junior at UC Berkeley, downloaded Co-Star following the goading of her friends. Although she likes how her natal chart and horoscopes prompt her to reflect on her personality traits, she resents how the app’s astrological forecasts can affect her perception of her day and personality. </p>
                <p> “I’ll be having a fine day and then Co-Star will tell me, ‘oh you’re having a sh*tty day,’ and then I feel like I’ll start having a sh*tty day,” Murray says. She adds, “I think that’s also to be said about negative traits– you’re kind of like, am I like this? And then maybe you’re not and you’re kind of just reaching to be who that is.” </p>
                <p> Science too, indicates that reading astrology affects perception. Studies show those who believe or consume astrology, compared to those who do not, are more susceptible to the <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/science/Barnum-Effect"> Barnum </a> effect, or the tendency to believe that vague, generalized statements accurately describe your personality. </p>

                <p>One <a href= "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167289154010?casa_token=P1t3DwoIaCcAAAAA:fM3wKGX5kUSXkkLtljGQCtQ_hPbfvfJ9J8mYYw6UE-poaV4GXBOGBlrGVanYGpC3vQL6Dw-C_3ok"> study </a>surveying high school students showed that, when handed two identical, generic personality descriptions, astrology believers were more likely to rank the personality text as an accurate description of themselves compared to skeptics. Yet, even skeptics were suaded by positive descriptions, particularly when they were told the descriptions were astrological. Write the scientists Glick, Gottesman and Jolton, “Although sceptics were generally less susceptible than believers to the Barnum effect, they nevertheless saw their bogus horoscopes as being highly accurate when the descriptions were favorable.” </p>
                <p>Horoscopes also affect how people interpret ensuing situations. In a 2018 <a href= "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916307826?via%3Dihub">study,</a> participants read either a positive or negative daily horoscope, and then interpreted neutral or ambiguous photographs. Those who read a positive horoscope interpreted the photographs in a positive manor, while those who read negative horoscopes perceived the captured situations in a negative light. Psychology makes clear that horoscopes affect how we interpret our personalities and environments, regardless of whether we believe them to be true or not. </p>
                <p> With the world spinning into an increasingly entropic state, history shows that astrology is likely to stay. Where Gen Z takes it, though, is up to them. </p>
